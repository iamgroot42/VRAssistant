<p>Microsoft announced its flagship smartphones, the Lumia 950 and 950XL, yesterday. Among other aspects, both the new Lumias feature liquid cooling. While that may sound like an overkill, it is actually a decent way to tackle the Snapdragon 810&rsquo;s thermal throttling woes. However, the details are a bit sketchy about how Microsoft may have implemented the technology on a smartphone.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="http://www.digit.in/top-products/top-10-smartphones-to-buy-in-india-1.html">smartphones </a>use passive cooling solutions like graphite foil sheets on the CPU, to dissipate the heat from the cellphone casing. A far more efficient method of cooling is attained through the use of phase-changing liquid cooling technology. Liquid cooling is essentially the same technology employed by users overclocking processors for PCs. A liquid cooling system consists of copper heat pipes connected to the processing unit, which circulate water. It also has a heat exchanger unit, that condenses the vapour. The heat emanated from the processor vaporizes the liquid inside. The vapour then moves to the heat exchanger, where it condenses back to liquid water.</p>

<p>In larger liquid cooling systems that are used for PCs, there is a pump that circulates the water through the water block. However, implementing such a system in smaller devices is rather difficult. A simpler liquid cooling technique is employed in <a href="http://www.digit.in/top-products/top-10-laptops-5.html">laptops</a>. It contains copper heat pipes, attached to the CPU and the GPU, which is connected to the radiator fan. The fan helps in dissipating the heat, thereby condensing the vapour back to water. The main hindrance in using liquid cooling technology in smartphones has been the difficulty in reducing the diameter of heat pipes to less than 3mm. A couple of years back, Japanese company NEC managed to create 0.6mm heat pipes to be used in the Medias X-06E phone. It was the world&rsquo;s first liquid-cooled phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digit.in/general/microsoft-windows-10-devices-all-you-need-to-know-27472.html">Microsoft</a> may have used a similar system to cool the new Lumia flagships. However, that begs the question of how Microsoft will manage to radiate the heat. It is technically not feasible to fit a fan on a smartphone. So, it has to resort to some other method of condensing the liquid. There might be a thermal diffusion plate, located away from the processor. In the absence of any further details, we are not really sure.</p>
<p>If the liquid cooling system indeed manages to keep the <a href="http://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-810-not-in-trouble-to-power-premium-handsets-25166.html">Snapdragon 810</a> cool, Microsoft might have a winner in the <a href="http://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/microsoft-announces-lumia-950-and-950xl-running-windows-10-27471.html">Lumia 950XL</a>. You might ask, is liquid cooling actually required in modern smartphones? The answer to that depends on a number of factors. Given the pace of advancement in mobile processing power, more powerful processors may pose thermal throttling issues. In this case, liquid cooling makes perfect sense. There are also overheating issues in entry-level SoCs, but it might not be economically feasible to incorporate liquid cooling in budget smartphones. Ultimately, it all depends on the processor the manufacturer chooses to use in its smartphones. If the new Lumia flagships turn out to be successful, expect more manufacturers to jump on to the liquid cooling bandwagon. If not for anything else, just for the novelty of it, until it wears off.</p>
